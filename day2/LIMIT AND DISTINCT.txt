===================================================
DISTINCT

==>The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
==>The DISTINCT clause filters and removes duplicate records from the resultset; hence, unique records will be left.
==>In MySQL, the DISTINCT clause doesn't ignore NULL values. So if you are using the DISTINCT clause in your SQL statement, your result set will include NULL as a distinct value.

Syntax:

    SELECT DISTINCT expressions  
    FROM tables  
    [WHERE conditions];  

mysql> select distinct dep_id from myemp;
mysql> select distinct job_id from myemp;
mysql> select distinct dep_id,mgr_id from myemp;



Example:
Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

Count Distinct
By using the DISTINCT keyword in a function called COUNT, we can return the number of different countries.
Example
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
==============================================================================================
MySQL DISTINCT and NULL values
When you specify a column that has NULL values in the DISTINCT clause, the DISTINCT clause will keep only one NULL value because it considers all NULL values are the same.

SELECT DISTINCT state
FROM customers;

ASSIGNMENTS


Weâ€™ll use the employees table from the sample database:
1)select unique last names by adding the DISTINCT clause  
2)get a unique combination of city and state from the customers table
