------

==>on each db tables,views will be created and these views will be given to developers to develop UI.
==>developers do not interact with original db tables,interact with views
==>view is xerox copy created on original copy
==>crud operations done thru views into db tables , updated happen in db tables
==>view is virtual table

What is a View in MySQL?

==>VIEW is a database object that can be created like a table. In SQL, a VIEW is similar to a virtual table of original db table. But unlike tables VIEWS don’t actually store data(no physical existence).
=> It is a temp table.
=> from select statement we will create views.So, when we query a view, it actually gets the data from the underlying database tables
=> view is nothing but WINDOW.
==>So, in simple words, we can say that the views in MySQL act as an interface between the actual database table(s) and the user.
==>like working with shadow,reflecting same view to us.
==>view can extract data from base table and display data to users,view doesnot store any data.
==>views are created with the help of select query
==>query execution and data storing takes place in db tables.
==>when we perform dml operations thru a view internally those operations are executed on base table and reflected in view.


Adv of views
==>VIEWS are complex SELECT statements used as virtual tables for ease of reference and reuse. The VIEWS are useful for storing complex SQL statements as a virtual table and request the VIEW as a single table instead of a complex query.
==>For security purposes, we can restrict users from accessing underlying tables and instead give access to views or virtual tables with limited columns. 
security can  be given at column or row level. which column there in views,those column data can be seen by user,remaining column will be hided.
==>if we want data who is working under dept 30,details of emp who work in dept 30 shld only be retrieved,create views on row.
==>checking integrity rules==>on base table,which kind of integrity rules we have applied,based on that thru view data can be accessed or inserted

What are the differences between a table and a view in MySQL?

1)    The table is physical i.e. it is an actual table whereas the view is logical i.e. it is a virtual table.
 2)A Table is an independent object whereas a view is a dependent object. That is a view depends on the table(s) from which it is going to fetch the data.
  3)  The Table stores the actual data of the database whereas View creates a logical subset of data from one or more tables.
   4) When a new table is created from an existing table, the new and old tables are independent themselves, that is the changes of one table will not be reflected into the other table whereas if a view is created based on a table, any changes that are performed on the table will reflect into the view and any changes performed on the view reflected in the table also.
===========================================
How many types of views are there in MySQL?

There are two types of views in MySQL, they are as follows.

    Simple view or Updatable views
    Complex view or non-updatable views.

What is a simple view or an Updatable view in MySQL?

==> view that is created based on the columns of a single table is known as a simple view in MySQL. In the Simple View, we can perform all the DML operations, so it is also called an updatable view.

==>A s per the query written in select statement,request will go to server,server will read the data and the reading data is showing
thru views.
==>whenever empview1 is called,internally select statement will get generated.
==>in view ,whatever query is written(saved),it will be executed, data retrieve from table

How to DROP a View in MySQL?

To drop a view in MySQL, we need to use the following syntax.
DROP VIEW viewname;
=======================================================
How to Modify a view in MySQL?

Once the view is created, later if you want to update the view, then you can also do the same in MySQL. 
To modify or update the already created view without dropping it we can use ALTER VIEW statement. Following is the syntax.

alter view view_name as
select * from table
where conditions;

For example, from our vwEmployee1 view, we also want to remove the name column. 

ALTER VIEW vwEmployee1 
AS    
SELECT Id, Department 
FROM Employee;  

Now, issue a select query against the view and you will see that only three columns’ data are returned from the Employee table.
==========================================================
What is a complex view in MySQL?

When we create a view based on more than 1 table by using MySQL JOIN, then it is known as a complex view and on a complex view, we can perform DML operations. So, a complex view is also called a non-updatable view.
==>when we called a view a complex view when
created on multiple base tables
using group by,having,distinct,joins or subquery

==>by default complex views are not allowed to perform dml operations
===============================================

Let us create a VIEW-based INNER JOIN SELECT statement. 
We want a view that will retrieve the data from the Emp and Department table and the column the view should include are EmployeeId, Employee Name, Salary, dept id and dept name. To do so, execute the below CREATE VIEW SQL Statement.

CREATE VIEW vwEmployees
AS 
SELECT emp.Id, emp.Name, emp.Salary
FROM Emp 
INNER JOIN Dept 
on Emp.dep_id=Dept.dep_id;

Now, issue a select query against the vwEmployees complex view by executing the below SQL SELECT Statement.

SELECT * FROM vwEmployees;

Once you execute the above query, you will get the following output which will retrieve the data from both Employee and Gender table 
=======================================================
MySQL Complex View Example

A view that is created based on a single table will also be considered as a complex view provided if the query contains Distinct. Aggregate Function, Group by Clause, having Clause, calculated columns, and set operations. 
For example, the following is a view based on the single table, but it will be considered as a complex view as it uses the group by clause.

CREATE VIEW vwCountEmployees
AS 
SELECT Department, Count(*) as TotalEmployee
FROM Employee Group BY Department;

//alias name shld be der for aggregate function
Now, issue a select query against the vwCountEmployees complex view by executing the below SQL SELECT Statement.

SELECT * FROM vwEmployees;

Once you execute the above SQL query, you will get the following output which will retrieve the aggregated data i.e. the Department name and the number of employees in each department as shown in the below image.
