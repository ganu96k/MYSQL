MySQL MAX() Function
The MySQL MAX() function is used to return the maximum value in a set of values of an expression. This aggregate function is useful when we need to find the maximum number, selecting the most expensive product, or getting the largest payment to the customer from your table.

1. Basic Example
Execute the following query that uses the MAX function to find the maximum income of the employee available in the table:

mysql>SELECT MAX(salary) AS "Maximum Income" FROM myemp; 


2. MySQL MAX() Function with WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause allows us to filter the result from the selected records.
mysql> SELECT MAX(salary) AS "Maximum_Income" FROM myemp   WHERE emp_id >= 100;  


3. MySQL MAX() Function with GROUP BY Clause
The GROUP BY clause allows us to collect data from multiple rows and group it based on one or more columns. For example, the following statement uses the MAX() function with the GROUP BY clause to find the maximum income in all rows from the employee table for each emp_age group.

mysql> SELECT emp_age, MAX(income) AS "Maximum Income"   
FROM employees   
GROUP BY emp_age;  
Output

After the successful execution, we can see that the maximum income of the employee returns by grouping them based on their age:

3. MySQL MAX() Function with HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause is always used with the GROUP BY clause to filter the records from the table. For example, the following statement returns the maximum income among all employees, grouping them based on their city and returns the result whose MAX(income) >= 200000.

mysql> SELECT city, MAX(income) AS "Maximum Income"   
FROM employees   
GROUP BY city  
HAVING MAX(income) >= 200000;  
Output

This statement will return the output as below:

5. MySQL MAX() Function with DISTINCT Clause
MySQL uses the DISTINCT keyword to remove the duplicate rows from the column name. We can also use this clause with MAX() function to return the maximum income value of a unique number of records present in the table.

Execute the following query that removes the duplicate records in the employee table's income column, group by city, and then returns the maximum value:

mysql> SELECT city, MAX(DISTINCT income) AS "Maximum Income"   
FROM employees   
GROUP BY city;

6. MySQL MAX() Function in Subquery Example
Sometimes it is required to use the subquery for returning the maximum value in the table. In that case, we use the following query:

mysql> SELECT * FROM employees WHERE   
emp_age = (SELECT MAX(emp_age) FROM employees);  
The subquery first finds the maximum age of employees from the table. Then, the main query (outer query) returns the result of age being equal to the maximum age returned from the subquery and other information.

Weâ€™ll use the payments table in the sample database to demonstrate the MAX() function.
1)MAX() function to return the largest amount of all payments:
2)uses the MAX() function to find the largest payment in 2004
